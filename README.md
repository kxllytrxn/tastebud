# Tastebud
CS160 Final Group Project - Tastebud

# To run locally:
[Instructions to install Node/NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
```
  cd tastebud-app
  npm install
  npm run dev

```

# How the repo is structured:
In tastebud-app is where all our code lies
in `tastebud-app/src`: our actual code with little folders with our components, features, pages etc

Vite generates the dist/ to deploy to sites but we don't need to worry about that!
